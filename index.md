# Markdown!

So, here is the thing: I don't know exactly how this is all going to work but I am giving it a try.

## H2 header ftw!

###### I am practising with header text sizes.

Smallest size.

###### Images!
Uploading an image from local folders can be done using HTML tags style, for instance the img tag, like below.
<img width="286" height="286" alt="Scientist" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80bee718-1d31-4e1e-b7f2-e3b23393f98a" />

Getting an image from an URL, you would need some name in square brackets preceded by an exclamation mark. Then the URL in round brackets.
